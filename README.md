# [Deliberate-Diligence.com](https://www.deliberate-diligence.com/) Obsidian Kickstart Vault Template

Hi all,

I recently demonstrated [on my Blog how I set up my Obsidian](https://www.deliberate-diligence.com/i-was-wrong-obsidian-is-better-than-roam-after-all/) after switching from Roam Research (and Notion before that). This post triggered some attention, and people asked me to share my vault template.

I'm happy to do that through this git repository. Feel free to use it and adapt it to your needs. 

## The Template follows some basic paradigms:
1. Periodic Note-taking, i.e. having a daily note as a central entry point
2. Simple task management with #tag hierarchies
3. A lot of plugins and customizations to streamline the day-by-day workflows.

## How to install
1. Download the files as a ZIP or so
2. Put it in a folder you can name like you wish your Obsidian vault to be titled.
If you intend to use it mainly on Apple devices, you should put the folder on iCloud
If not, you can put it anywhere where you want.
3. I am synching my Vault across Windows/Mac, so I am using the [Sync plan from Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/sync), which works fine. Otherwise, you can choose other cloud drives (e.g. OneDrive, Google Drive, iCloud, etc.)

## How do I use the Deliberate Diligence vault template?
